ATTENTION!!!
file completion in progress... 


What does it do?

Envlogger allows the user to record enviromental variables (temperature, barometric pressure and humidity) in real time using the raspberry pi sensor hat.

The program will give some level of control to define the frequency and the extension of the logging time.

After the process is completed, the results will be recorded in a file named: sensefile.dat.

included files:
envlogger.py: "desktop" version of the logging program
envlogger_a.py: "standalone" version of the logging program
sensefile.dat: sample datafile (optional)
sensefile1.dat: sample data file
